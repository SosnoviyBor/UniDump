I recently visited a beautiful coastal town for my vacation.
The pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters were breathtaking.
As I strolled along the shore, I couldn't help but admire the vibrant marine life.
Colorful fish darted in and out of coral reefs, while seagulls glided gracefully above.
The coastal breeze was refreshing, and the sound of crashing waves was soothing.
I spent hours exploring the tide pools, searching for seashells and other treasures.
It was a truly unforgettable experience.
